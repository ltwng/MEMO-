# MEMO-
MEMO is an interactive music system for real-time sonic iteration which embodies pre-determined extensible scenarios as well as generative methods developed at Max software environment.

Please make sure that you install the following Max packages to run the patch smoothly:



1- Petra by Circuit Music Labs 

2- Mc.Movement.Studies by Dillon Bastan & Cycling 74

3- LowkeyNW by Nathan Wolek

These can all be found in the Package Manager in Max.
